# Assignment Answers

## 1. Components of a DBMS (Database Management System)
- Hardware: Physical devices like computers, servers, and storage systems that host the DBMS.  
- Software: The DBMS program itself, which controls database access and management.  
- Data: Centralized storage of data that the DBMS manages.  
- Procedures: Instructions and rules for users and administrators on operating the DBMS.  
- Database Access Language: Languages for querying and managing data example SQL.  
- Users: Includes database admins, developers, and end-users who interact with the database management system.  

## 2. What is a Relational Database?  
A relational database stores data in structured tables  with rows and columns, relationships between tables are established using keys.
## 3. Three Classifications of SQL  
- **Data Definition Language:** Commands to define and modify database structure such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP.  
- **Data Manipulation Language):** Commands for querying and modifying data exmple, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.  
- **Data Control Language:** Commands to control access and permissions example GRANT, REVOKE.  

## 4. Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key  
- **Primary Key:**  A unique identifier for rows in a table meant for ensuring no duplicate values.  
- **Foreign Key:**  A reference to a primary key in another table, establishing relationship between tables.  

## 5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?  
An ERD visually represents entities, their attributes, and relationships in a database. It helps in database design by mapping out the structure before implementation.  

## 6. Advantages of Relational Databases  
- **Data Integrity:**  Maintains data accuracy and consistency.  
- **Scalability:**  Handles large datasets efficiently.  
- **Flexibility:**  Allows easy querying and updates using SQL.  
- **Data Relationships:**  Supports complex data relationships with foreign keys.  

## 7. Four Data Types Used in Tables  
- **Integer:**  Stores whole numbers.  
- **String:**  Stores text.  
- **DateTime:**  Stores date and time values.  
- **Float:**  Stores decimal numbers.  

## 8. Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)  
A DBMS provides a platform to store, organize, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. It ensures data security, consistency, and integrity while supporting multiple users and large datasets.
