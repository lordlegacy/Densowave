# Assignment Answers

## 1. Components of a DBMS (Database Management System)
- **Hardware:**  
  Physical devices like computers, servers, and storage systems that host the DBMS.  
- **Software:**  
  The DBMS program itself, which controls database access and management.  
- **Data:**  
  Centralized storage of data that the DBMS manages.  
- **Procedures:**  
  Instructions and rules for users and administrators on operating the DBMS.  
- **Database Access Language:**  
  Languages like SQL for querying and managing data.  
- **Users:**  
  Includes database administrators, developers, and end-users who interact with the system.  

## 2. What is a Relational Database?  
A relational database stores data in structured tables (relations) with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established using keys.  

**Examples:**  
- MySQL  
- PostgreSQL  
- Oracle Database  
- Microsoft SQL Server  

## 3. Three Classifications of SQL  
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):**  
  Commands to define and modify database structure (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).  
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**  
  Commands for querying and modifying data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).  
- **DCL (Data Control Language):**  
  Commands to control access and permissions (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).  

## 4. Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key  
- **Primary Key:**  
  A unique identifier for rows in a table. Ensures no duplicate values.  
- **Foreign Key:**  
  A reference to a primary key in another table, establishing relationships between tables.  

## 5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?  
An ERD visually represents entities, their attributes, and relationships in a database. It helps in database design by mapping out the structure before implementation.  

## 6. Advantages of Relational Databases  
- **Data Integrity:**  
  Maintains data accuracy and consistency.  
- **Scalability:**  
  Handles large datasets efficiently.  
- **Flexibility:**  
  Allows easy querying and updates using SQL.  
- **Data Relationships:**  
  Supports complex data relationships with foreign keys.  

## 7. Four Data Types Used in Tables  
- **Integer:**  
  Stores whole numbers.  
- **String:**  
  Stores text (e.g., `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`).  
- **Date/Time:**  
  Stores date and time values.  
- **Float/Double:**  
  Stores decimal numbers.  

## 8. Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)  
A DBMS provides a platform to store, organize, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. It ensures data security, consistency, and integrity while supporting multiple users and large datasets.
